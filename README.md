I have used MVP architecture pattern to design architecture of the proejct. The data is mocked from the local asset folder and bind to the UI.

I have created Vertical RecyclerView whose viewholder contains horizontalrecyclerview. Horizontalrecyclerview's viewholder contain linear layout which add and removes cardview dynamically. Cardview contain textview.   

When you select item from the menu namely 1,2,3 or 4 the Linearlayout of the horizontal view holder will add the text view as per the item selected.
